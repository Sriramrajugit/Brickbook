## 🔒 Local HTTPS Setup Complete! ✅

### Server Status
- **Status**: ✅ Running
- **Protocol**: HTTPS
- **URL**: https://localhost:3000
- **Certificates**: Auto-generated by Next.js (stored in `certificates/` folder)
- **CA Certificate**: Stored in `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\mkcert`

### What Just Happened
1. ✅ Next.js generated self-signed SSL certificates automatically
2. ✅ Your app is now running on HTTPS locally
3. ✅ Cookie security settings updated to work with HTTPS
4. ✅ Environment variables configured for HTTPS URLs

### How to Access Your App

**Option 1: Direct Access (Recommended)**
- Open browser: `https://localhost:3000`
- You'll see a certificate warning (normal for self-signed certs)
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
- Now you're in HTTPS! ✅

**Option 2: Stop and Restart**
When you need to stop the dev server:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
2. To restart: Run `npm run dev:https` again

### Testing the HTTPS Setup

**Step 1: Check Certificate**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Security tab
- Should show "Certificate is not trusted" (expected)
- This proves HTTPS is working

**Step 2: Check Cookies**
- Go to Application tab → Cookies → https://localhost:3000
- The auth token should have "Secure" flag ✅

**Step 3: Login Test**
- Your login should work normally
- Check that session persists across page reloads
- Logout should clear the cookie

### Files Created/Modified

📄 **Modified Files:**
- `app/api/login/route.ts` - Secure cookie flag updated
- `.env` - Added NEXTAUTH_URL for HTTPS

📄 **New Files:**
- `certificates/` - Directory with auto-generated SSL certs
- `HTTPS_LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup documentation
- `scripts/start-https-dev.ps1` - Convenience startup script

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Self-Signed Certificates**
- Only for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
- Users won't see warnings in production
- Railway handles production SSL automatically

### Production vs Local

| Feature | Local (HTTPS) | Production |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Certificate | Self-signed ⚠️ | Let's Encrypt ✅ |
| Browser Warning | Yes | No |
| Cookie Secure Flag | true | true |
| How to Deploy | Ready! | Push to GitHub → Railway deploys |

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Test login/logout with HTTPS
2. ✅ Check all features work properly
3. ✅ Commit changes to git
4. ✅ Push to GitHub for Railway deployment

### Troubleshooting

**Certificate Error Persists?**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Port Already in Use?**
- Kill process: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe`
- Restart: `npm run dev:https`

**Need HTTP for Testing?**
- Run `npm run dev` instead (no HTTPS)
